🎯 Project Goal
Build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of the three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

based on the flower’s sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Covered
This project strengthens core ML foundations:

✅ Supervised Learning – Train the model on labeled data

🧪 Classification – Predict categorical labels

📥 Data Loading – Import datasets using scikit-learn

📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Summary stats and plots

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Feature/target split

✂️ Train-Test Split – Evaluate generalization

🧠 Model Selection – Logistic Regression (baseline)

🏋️ Model Training – Learn from training data

🧾 Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

🔮 Prediction – Predict unseen test data

📊 Dataset
We use the classic Iris Dataset (built into scikit-learn) consisting of:

📌 150 samples

50 each from:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

📐 4 Features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

📈 Results and Evaluation
The Logistic Regression model performs very well due to the dataset’s linear separability, especially for Iris Setosa 🌼.

🔍 Evaluation Metrics included:

Metric	Description
✅ Accuracy Score	Overall correctness of predictions
📋 Classification Report	Precision, Recall, F1-score per class
🧩 Confusion Matrix	Insights into misclassifications

✨ Outcome: High performance with minimal tuning – a great example of applying simple models to structured datasets.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Here are ways you can take this project further:

🛠️ Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV for better optimization

🔁 Try Other Models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)

📏 Feature Scaling: Normalize data using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler

📉 Advanced Visualizations: Plot decision boundaries and feature interactions
