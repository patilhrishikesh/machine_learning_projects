🎯 Project Goal:

Build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of the three species:

     1)Setosa
    
     2)Versicolor
    
     3)Virginica

based on the flower’s sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Covered:

This project strengthens core ML foundations:

      ✅ Supervised Learning – Train the model on labeled data
      
      🧪 Classification – Predict categorical labels
      
      📥 Data Loading – Import datasets using scikit-learn
      
      📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Summary stats and plots
      
      🧹 Data Preprocessing – Feature/target split
      
      ✂️ Train-Test Split – Evaluate generalization
      
      🧠 Model Selection – Logistic Regression (baseline)
      
      🏋️ Model Training – Learn from training data
      
      🧾 Model Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
      
      🔮 Prediction – Predict unseen test data
      
📊 Dataset:

We use the classic Iris Dataset (built into scikit-learn) consisting of:

      📌 150 samples
      
      50 each from:
      
      Iris Setosa
      
      Iris Versicolor
      
      Iris Virginica

📐 4 Features:

      Sepal Length (cm)
      
      Sepal Width (cm)
      
      Petal Length (cm)
      
      Petal Width (cm)
